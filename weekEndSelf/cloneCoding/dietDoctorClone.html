            <h1>Recipe FAQ</h1>
            <p>On this page, we have collected the most frequently asked questions regarding our recipes. For example, the difference between net and total carbs, and why most of our side dishes are classified as either moderate or liberal low carb.</p>
            <div></div>
            <h1>Food policy</h1>
            <p>What do we mean by healthy food, and how do we define our different levels of low carb? Learn more about what you can expect from our recipes. And, of course, the evidence and reasons behind where we stand.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="main m-content4">
            <h1>Which is the best low-carb diet?</h1>
            <p>We’re all different. That’s why we offer recipes with a spectrum of carb, fat, and protein levels to suit everyone’s needs. On top of that, we also provide dairy-free, vegetarian, and vegan dietary options. We suggest that you try our different kinds of recipes to see what works for you.</p>
            <p>All of our recipes are nutritious and much lower in carbs than “traditional” recipes, so most people can mix and match the recipes they love the most and still reach their health goals. At the end of the day, the best diet is the one you can turn into a lifestyle.</p>
            <p>Each recipe has a colored circle, indicating the strictness (yellow = moderate low carb, orange = liberal low carb, green = keto), carb count, and protein level (the blue outline). Hover or click the circle on the recipe images to see full nutrition information.</p>

                     <h1>Low carb</h1>
                     <p>Our family-friendly moderate and liberal low-carb recipes (5-20 E% net carbs) restrict your carb intake while being flexible. In addition to weight loss, a low-carb diet is beneficial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>

                     <p>Our top-rated ketogenic recipes (5 E% or 7 g of net carbs or less if it’s a meal) are a bit more restrictive. Still, they are usually more effective for weight loss without hunger and to reverse type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.</p>
